# BlackJack
This is a game where the user can play a game of Black Jack against the computer. 
The computer has been coded to choose whether it should hit or stand, making it even more difficult for the player to win as the computer is capable of making a proper decision based on the cards it is given, simulating a real BlackJack game.
